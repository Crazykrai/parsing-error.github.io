THIS ISNT CODE THIS IS JUST A SCRIPT FOR THE PRESENTATION

*Sankalp doesn't talk much, he'll be operating and introducing the site*

Ayush: Now we'll show you some of the many things our site can do.
Let's start with the home page. Here we have a very brief description of what
our company does. *Reads actual thing*

Braedon: Next up we have the About Us tab, which shows us three and what type of code
we are the most versed with. 

Braedon: After that we have the Our Story tab which gives customers some "background" on
our company. *Reads actual thing*

Ayush: Finally we have the Request tab. Here we have embeded a Google Form into 
the code that allows people to send us a help request. The form is connected to a google
sheet that compiles all of the sent information.

Ayush: Thanks for listening to our presentation. We all worked really hard on this site
and we hope you liked it.
