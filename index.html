                <p>Our company began in 1984 when our fathers' fathers' fathers started debugging his friend's code and charged him. Over the years of our fathers' fathers' fathers debugging code, they eventually turned it into a small company which died off after their death's. We're here to pick back up the torch our fathers' fathers' fathers lit and make it burn even brighter. </p>
